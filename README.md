Abstract:
This research addresses the urgent need for sophisticated and effective tomato plant disease detection methods in India's agricultural landscape. Tomatoes, a crucial crop for culinary richness and economic sustenance, face formidable challenges from bacterial, fungal, and viral infections. Existing detection methods rely on image processing and machine learning, yet limitations persist in terms of accuracy, generalization, and real-time applicability. This paper proposes a novel Tomato Plant Disease Predictor comprising a feature extractor and classifier integrating real-time imaging and a fine-tuned Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The methodology aims to overcome current shortcomings and enhance precision, applicability, and generalization. The findings promise to benefit farmers by revolutionizing agricultural practices, lessening workloads, and promoting sustainable solutions.

Keywords: Tomato disease detection, real-time cameras, computer vision, machine learning, image processing.
